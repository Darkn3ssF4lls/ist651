# ist658
The following repository contains the final project files created by Daniel Lewis for `IST651 - Scripting for Enterprise Data Systems`. The purpose of the repository is to configure a Fedora 30 Desktop virtual machine to perform as a QEMU-KVM virtualizion host. To help structure the project I have broken it down into -files that effect the host-, -files that effect the guests-, and -xml configuration files-. Per the instructors guidence this readme file will be considered the `small text file (or pdf) that describes the contents/purpose of each file.` Addtionally, each script will either contain a line by line description of its executed purpose or a sumary comment with the scripts attributes defined.
